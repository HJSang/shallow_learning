# KNN algrorithm 
K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is a non-parameteric method.
* In KNN classification, an objecti is classified by a plurality vot of the neighbors.
* In KNN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.


## Distance Metrics
* Euclidean distance for continuouse variables
* For discrete variables, we can use the **overlap metric**. [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) for text classification.
* The distance metric can be learned with specialized alhorithms. 
  * [Large Margin Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_margin_nearest_neighbor).
